## ‚ú® Features

-   **Modern Landing Page**: A creative and engaging hero section with a video background.
-   **Creative Category Display**: An interactive accordion-style list for browsing makeup categories and subcategories.

-   **Seamless Booking Flow**: A simple multi-step process from selecting a service to booking an artist.
-   **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first approach ensuring a great experience on all devices.

## üé® Design Choices

-   **Theme**: The design uses a sophisticated and elegant color palette (`primary: #D6A2E8`, `dark: #2C3E50`) to align with the makeup and beauty industry.
-   **Typography**: A combination of `Playfair Display` (serif) for headings and `Poppins` (sans-serif) for body text was chosen to create a modern and high-end feel.
-   **Hero Section**: Instead of a static image, a dynamic video background was used to immediately capture user attention and convey the artistry and movement associated with makeup.
-   **Categories Section**: An accordion/collapsible list was chosen over a simple grid to present a large number of categories in a clean, organized, and interactive way. It prevents overwhelming the user and encourages exploration.
-   **UI/UX**: The flow is designed to be intuitive. Clear call-to-action buttons, auto-filled form fields, and a detailed confirmation page guide the user smoothly through the booking process.
